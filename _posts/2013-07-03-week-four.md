## Day 1 (6/24)
  + Ack! Can you believe it's week four already?! I've hardly done
  anything! Today was productive though.
  + My first order of business was to visually map out the fault
  analysis code, as per all the literature proposed it would run,
  and then connect steps of the verbal process with python files and
  bash scripts in the various folders. It looked like [this](http://cl.ly/image/272Y0C3g0q1f) when I was done with it.
  + Once I felt comfortable with the order of the code execution, I went
  into each file and drilled down into each call for each script to 
  figure out when everything was going. I was really happy with the 
  progress I was making in the file when I got to the part where
  the fault simulations were supposed to happen. But that script kept
  throwing errors, and when I went to look around, I realized pretty
  much every functional line of code in that script had been commented
  out, so it was doing nothing. Why? Who knows. That's on tomorrow's TODO.
  + Then, to add to my confusion, once I reached the end of what seemed to
  be the all-encompassing fault_simulation script, I saw it made a
  call to execute another script, called fault_two. What's fault_two?
  From my cursory investigation, it seems to be an almost exact copy of
  the first fault_simulation script. Why is everything happening twice?
  Again, tomorrow's TODO. Mysteries galore today.
