My name is Amrita Mazumdar, and I'm a rising senior at 
Columbia University, majoring in Computer Engineering 
and minoring in English. I'm originally from central 
New Jersey. In my spare time, I enjoy running and photography,
and can usually be found making smoothies or drinking coffee.

You can find more about me about
