## Day 2 TODOS
+ read through/comment/organize the helper functions
+ outline find_chains original

## Day 1
 + Surprise of the day: I finished two of my next week TODO's in like 5 minutes! 
 I got fastscan working over the weekend, with help from Marco (again), and once
 that got fixed, I was able to find the clearly broken paths much more easily.
 Now I have the whole scripting bundle operating properly. Turns out I was
 missing a fairly critical script that got all the fastscan permissions and paths
 and now that that works, the scripts seem to be doing
 a lot more of what they're supposed to.
 + I spent most of the morning trying to figure out what's going on in the "validation"
 part of the script (part two of the circuit synthesis workflow). It's all in perl, 
 which is really nebulous to me, but the scripts seem to be missing some parameter
 that I can't seem to figure out.
 + Then Dr. Bahar chatted with Marco and I about what I should be
 getting up to this week and next, especially because she's going to be away soon, and 
 we decided that my efforts would be best spent looking at the 
 "find-chains", "fault" and "spice" scripts, because that was where the least generic
 code had been written that needs the most work. So I tabled my investigation of the
 "validation" scripts until Marco finishes prelims and then we can sourt out annoying things
 like that.
 + The afternoon was spent combing through all the different versions (ten of them!) of the 
 find-chains script. It's a little dense, and after combing through all of the initial find-chains
 script only to find that v2 had changed most of the organization, I decided a better
 tactic would be to pick a critical function that spans most-to-all of the versions and 
 map how they change across iterations of the script. The first function I picked was "score_chains",
 because in order to make the best chain of implications, the code needs to be able to
 rank all the possible chains somehow. There were some interesting differences in how
 the chain scoring was evaluated, and the comments in the later versions noted that
 most weights were chosen arbitrarily (I'm sure there was some testing involved
 to come up with reasonable numbers) and it got me thinking about how we could automate
 finding the optimal weights for the different heuristics used.
 + I'm still a little confused about how the fault simulations are connecting with
 the implication chain scripts as they currently stand. It would be helpful if I 
 clarified that, but that should also be able to wait until I finish consolidating the find-chains
 script, which is looking to be on the herculean side.
