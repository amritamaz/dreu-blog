## Day 1
 + I got fastscan working over the weekend, with help from Marco (again). I was
 missing a fairly critical script that got all the fastscan permissions and paths
 set up for scripting, and now that that works, the scripts seem to be doing
 a lot more of what they're supposed to.
 + I spent most of the morning trying to figure out what's going on in the "validation"
 part of the script. It's all in perl, which is really nebulous to me, but the scripts
 don't seem to be working correctly and I have a feeling there are just some parameters
 missing somewhere. 
 + Then Dr. Bahar chatted with Marco and I about what I should be
 getting up to this week and next, especially because she's going to be away soon, and 
 we decided that my efforts would be best spent looking at the 
 "find-chains", "fault" and "spice" scripts, because that was where the least generic
 code had been written that needs the most work. So I tabled my investigation of the
 "validation" scripts until Marco finishes prelims and then we can do annoying things
 like that.
 + The afternoon was spent combing through all the different versions (ten of them!) of the 
 find-chains script. It's a little dense, and after combing through all of the initial find-chains
 script only to find that v2 had changed most of the organization, I decided a better
 tactic would be to pick a critical function that spans most-to-all of the versions and 
 map how they change across iterations of the script. The first function I picked was "score_chains",
 because in order to make the best chain of implications, the code needs to be able to
 rank all the possible chains somehow. There were some interesting differences in how
 the chain scoring was executed, and the comments in the later versions noted that
 after a while the weights were chosen arbitrarily (I'm sure there was some testing involved
 to come up with reasonable numbers) and it got me thinking about how we could automate
 finding the best weights for the different heuristics used.
 + I'm still a little confused about how the fault simulations are connecting with
 the implication chain scripts as they currently stand. It would be helpful if I 
 clarified that, but that might also be able to wait until I finish consolidating the find-chains
 script.
