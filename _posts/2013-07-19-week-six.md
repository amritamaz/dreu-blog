## Day 1 (7/15)
  + Last week right before I left I discovered that fastscan was choking on the pattern files
  for fault simulation. That was like a big hairy mess I didn't want to look at, so I tabled
  it for this week, and today I got started. I discovered that the pattern files being
  generated for testing had some syntax errors and were weirdly missing some lines. So first
  I dug around until I found where the lines were supposed to be written. Then I tested it
  again on rd53 to see if this was a circuit-specific problem or if some code accidentally
  was removed. It turned out that the script for parsing pattern files was very hard-coded
  and could not cope with the larger circuit pattern files. I made the script more flexible,
  and then it generated faults for rd73! Very exciting.
  + My next task was to generate the spice files for testing. Marco told me I needed a grey
  code for the input values, and since the rd73 circuit has 7 inputs, I needed a 7-bit grey code.
  Grey codes are a little confusing and scale in a really overwhelming way, so I spent a little 
  while writing a script that generates the grey code, so I can add that to the automation also.
  + Then I realized that I'd have to manually remove the duplicate implications (not really
  duplicates, but they both cover the same gate) so I set to work automating that. I figure
  holding up my progress a little now is better than doing it on my own a few times and then having
  to automate it anyway. For some reason fastscan is running _very_ slowly and it's having
  a negative effect on my productivity, but Marco and I troubleshot it for a while and couldn't
  figure out the source. Until then I'll just multitask a bit more with a few different problems.
