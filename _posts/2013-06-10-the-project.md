## An Automated Synthesis Tool for Generating Noise-Immune Sub-Threshold Circuits
My project for the summer is to build an <b>automatic synthesis tool</b>
for noise-immune sub-threshold circuit design based on selective
use of Schmitt-trigger logic. Dr. Bahar's group has been developing a 
technique for designing noise-immune circuits, and my goal is to 
automate this technique to dynamically synthesize a circuit that
maximizes noise suppression with minimal area overhead by including 
Schmitt-trigger logic at the most failure-prone nodes in a circuit. 

<b>Research Summary</b>: Prior work has demonstrated invariant relationships, or
implications, to be an effective means of detecting errors in sub-threshold circuits.
We propose strategically replacing gates in a circuit with their modified Schmitt-trigger
equivalent so as to reinforce invariant relationships throughout the circuit. Our goal is
to effectively place these modified gates so as to supress noise at a circuit's outputs and
reduce errors. We weigh different heuristics and strategies for placing implications,
including chain-building based on high-activation probability and node distances, reinforcing high-fault
nodes, and determining low-fault nodes for use as steady implicants.

## Final Deliverables

I presented a poster at the Brown Summer Research Symposium on August 2, 2013. A PDF version of the slides 
can be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dreu_poster.pdf">here</a>.

I also wrote a paper for DREU on my summer work. You can read it <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dreu_paper.pdf">here</a>.

## About Dr. Bahar

My mentor for the summer is Dr. Iris Bahar, a professor 
in the computer engineering department at Brown. Her 
research is in the areas of computer architecture, 
electronic design automation, and digital circuit design.

## About Marco

On a day-to-day basis I am being advised by Marco Donato,
 a Ph. D student at Brown who is actively working on this research.
 
## About the DREU Program

DREU (Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates) 
is a research internship program that promotes research 
opportunities in computer science for women and students 
from underrepresented groups. Its goal is to increase the 
number of students in these categories that go into 
graduate studies.
