Day 2 (8/6):

Day 1 (8/5):
  + I have a long list of simulations to do this week, and then I have to analyze them
  and figure out what qualities are best in our simulation sets and try to integrate
  them together.
  + Today I hoped to do like three different circuits of chain implication sets, but
  I got really bogged down in figuring out my workflow (as always) and then I ran a 
  ton of rd53 simulations that didn't work at all because I had mistakenly not generated
  enough noise files. It took me a very long time to figure that out, and so while
  I also did the prep work for my other circuits, but didn't run any simulations because
  it may or may not have taken me four hours to understand why the simulations were not
  working as expected, and another two hours to actually run the simulations correctly.
  + Finished simulations today: rd53_chains, all sets
