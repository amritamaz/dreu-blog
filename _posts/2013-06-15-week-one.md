## Day 1
 + got set up w keys, everything
 + given papers to read, for project
 + set up workspace
 + going to be working w spice and cadence and stuff
 + read two papers, got settled, etc

## Day 2
 + met w marco, cleared up a lot of confusions
 + read more papers
 + given first week's assignment: simulate some of the circuits in spice, 
 make a schmitt trigger flip flop in spice and add it to the end of the output


## Day 3
 + mucked around with the code bases. seems that most of the scripts are in an
  svn repo, and marco sent me some of the spice files
 + having trouble running the simulations, which is just as well because it is 
 giving me the opportunity to really pour through the spice net lists and 
 deconstruct them really well. having transient timestamp too small errors.
 + Understanding someone else's codebase is tough work.

## Day 4
 + today I made the executive decision that spice sims weren't going to work out
 until I got an email address. Dr. Bahar checked up on the status of our ID's
 and hopefully it should be soon!
 + Instead, I decided to go through the whole code base. My python is a little
 rusty so I'm glad I took the time to step through what all the scripts did
 before jumping into any work anyway. 
 + I found out I needed to load up a newer version of Python and install it
 in my user home directory, and compiling that took a little while (it still
 didn't pass all the make tests, but I think that has something to with the
 LEMS network and less to do with me). I also found that I'm _still_ missing a
 bit of the codebase, so I went through and made a list of all the apparently
 missing scripts and such. Marco and I have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow
 so I will probably sort that out then.
