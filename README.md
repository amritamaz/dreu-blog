# DREU - Distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates

    www.amritamaz.me/dreu-blog

This is a small blog documenting my experience at Brown University
doing research through the DREU Program. 
This summer, I'm working with Dr. Iris Bahar
on developing automated synthesis tools for noise-immune 
sub-threshold circuit design.


This blog is required for the DREU program, and contains an
overview of my project and mentors, a weekly log of my activity,
and, eventually, my final report. 

Site is powered by Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages,
at least until it is moved to the DREU homepage at the end of the summer.
You can find the source at the gh-pages branch of this repo.
