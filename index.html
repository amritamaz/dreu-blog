This website is a record of my summer research experience at Brown 
University for the Distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates
(DREU) program. This summer, I'll be spending 10 weeks doing research
on techniques for online soft error correction in combinational logic
under the direction of Professor Iris Bahar.
