This website is a record of my summer research experience at 
<a href="http://www.brown.edu">Brown University</a> for the 
Distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates
(<a href="https://parasol.tamu.edu/dreu/">DREU</a>) program. 

You can use the links on the right to read about my project,
 the people involved, or a week-by-week log of my experience.
